                    <p class="lead text-muted">It began with a Student Government initiative, and then very quickly became a working product! You may not have known this, but this application was created as a senior design project. This project would not have come to fruition if it wasn't for the support of our administrators, advisors, and most importantly, the individuals from IT@UC! See below for more information on how the Stocker Application came to be.</p>

                <h2>Senior Design Students</h2>
                <p class="lead">These three students lead the planning, design, development, and implementation of the Bearcats Pantry Stocker Application. Although there were many options for senior design projects, this group wanted to contribute to something that would serve students for many years to come. This project instantly stuck out as one that would impact students from every corner of the university. Development of this project began in August 2020, and concluded in April 2021. Overall, the group contributed hundreds of hours into this project over the span of 9 months.</p>
