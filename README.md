# Bearcats Pantry Stocker Application
The Bearcats Pantry is a great resource for students but is not in the most accessible location. By creating an ordering system for students online, and having the items delivered directly to them at their residence, we can ensure that every student has access to food, and hygienic items.

## Commit/Push Notes
- Always make sure the [env](frontend/environment.json) variable is in the correct state. Set to "dev" when testing but ALWAYS make sure it is in "prod" on the repo and live server.
- Not necessary, but try to ignore the createdFile and inputFile lists that are created locally when developing. However, server will create new ones when code is redeployed.
